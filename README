Page Table

Files that should be in this directory:
	-main.c
	-oss.c
	-user.c
	-info.h
	-Makefile
	-logfile* (if ran with defaults)
	-hidden .git directory
	-this README

Getting started: Type the command: make proj6
	Files should compile and you should be left with 3 executables in the directory: proj6, oss, and user.

Running proj6: please type the options in the order you see here: ./proj6 -s x -l filename
	I ran into some trouble getting the optarg to work with global variables and forked items so the argvs are hardcoded in array positions

Items implemented
	-Logging (maybe not complete, but definitely in a workable state)
	-Shared memory initialization and cleanup
	-Semaphore init (not completely finished in usage)
	-Shared memory message queue/message passing from user to oss
	-Setting of logfiles/maxproc by passing arguments OR running with defaults
	-User usage of shared memory

Things not implemented in this project:
	-Complete usage of page table (struct initialized)

Notes:
	-Definitely felt better with my understanding of shared memory/message queues/IPC after this one and I feel like I have a way better representation of it in this project; despite not getting all the way through the final pieces of using the page table.
	-I appreciate the extension, honestly. It really helped me nail down some of the stuff I had fallen a little behind on.
	-It's not very polished, and there may be a few debug items still left uncommented, but I've eaten up enough time and need to get this turned in.
